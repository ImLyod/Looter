Effective Date: October 20, 2025  
Version: 1.3  

---

1. AGREEMENT TO TERMS  
By purchasing, downloading, or using FNTDLOOTER, LOOTER, or FNTD2LOOTER (collectively referred to as “the Software” or “the Product”), you acknowledge and agree to be bound by this Terms of Service agreement.

MANDATORY PRE-PURCHASE AGREEMENT  
Before completing any purchase, you are required to read and agree to these Terms of Service in full. By confirming your payment through Stripe or any authorized reseller, you are legally acknowledging that you have read, understood, and accepted all terms stated in this document, including the refund policy below.  
If you do not agree, do not proceed with the purchase or use of the Software.

---

2. OWNERSHIP AND LICENSE  
Upon successful purchase, you are granted permanent ownership of your individual copy of the Software. You may use it indefinitely on your authorized device(s).

Ownership of your personal copy does not transfer intellectual property rights — all trademarks, source code, and brand materials remain the property of the developers (“we”, “our”, or “the Team”).

YOU MAY:  
• Use the Software permanently after valid purchase.  
• Access future updates or patches released by us.  
• Back up your copy for personal use.

YOU MAY NOT:  
• Distribute, resell, or share your license or authentication key.  
• Modify, reverse-engineer, or decompile the Software.  
• Circumvent authentication or verification systems.  
• Use the Software for malicious, exploitative, or unlawful purposes.

---

3. GLOBAL AVAILABILITY  
The Software is available for purchase and use worldwide. It is your responsibility to ensure the Software’s legality and compliance with the rules and regulations of your country, jurisdiction, or platform.  
Certain regional restrictions may apply, and functionality can vary by region.

---

4. USER RESPONSIBILITY  
You are solely responsible for:  
• Keeping your authentication key and credentials secure.  
• Verifying that your device and system meet compatibility requirements.  
• Using the Software ethically and within the laws and rules of your region and platform.

Loss, theft, or exposure of your authentication key will not qualify for replacement or refund.

---

5. UPDATES AND MODIFICATIONS  
We may release updates, feature enhancements, or compatibility patches at any time.  
Updates are provided at our discretion and may change or remove features to maintain functionality or security.

We are not obligated to maintain legacy versions of the Software.

---

6. TERMINATION AND REVOCATION  
Although ownership is permanent, your license may be suspended or invalidated if you:  
• Intentionally distribute, leak, or resell your license key.  
• Attempt to bypass, crack, or alter the Software’s verification process.  
• Commit fraud, chargebacks, or payment disputes.  
• Violate these Terms or any associated policies.

Termination for any of the above reasons voids all support and refund eligibility.

---

7. REFUND POLICY  

7.1 GENERAL POLICY  
All sales are final. Because the Software is digital and license-based, refunds cannot be issued once an authentication key or license has been generated and delivered.

7.2 REFUND ELIGIBILITY  
Refunds may only be considered under the following limited conditions:  
• Duplicate purchase caused by technical or payment error.  
• Payment processed successfully but no valid license key was received.  
• Verified Stripe processing error confirmed by the payment provider.

Refunds will NOT be issued for:  
• Change of mind after purchase.  
• Lost, shared, or compromised license keys.  
• Incompatibility with your hardware, system, or third-party software.  
• Account or license termination due to Terms violation.

7.3 REQUESTING A REFUND  
To request a refund, contact a verified developer through our official Discord support channel within 7 days of purchase. Provide your payment receipt, transaction ID, and explanation of your issue.

7.4 PROCESSING  
If approved, refunds are processed within 5–10 business days through Stripe, our secure payment partner.

7.5 PAYMENT HANDLING  
All transactions are processed by Stripe. We do not store, collect, or have access to personal payment information or credit card details.

---

8. WARRANTY DISCLAIMER  
The Software is provided “as is” and “as available” without warranties of any kind, express or implied.

We are not liable for:  
• Data loss, system issues, or account bans caused by Software usage.  
• Downtime or external service interruptions.  
• Any indirect or incidental damages resulting from installation or operation.

Your only remedy for dissatisfaction is to discontinue use.

---

9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY  
To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, our total liability shall never exceed the original purchase price of the Software. Some regions may not allow certain limitations; in those cases, local consumer rights may apply.

---

10. GOVERNING LAW  
These Terms are governed by international commercial standards, regardless of where you reside or purchase from.  
Any dispute shall be resolved first through direct communication with the developers.  
If unresolved, disputes may proceed to neutral arbitration, where applicable under international e-commerce law.

Initiating chargebacks or malicious disputes without proper communication may result in permanent license suspension.

---

11. CONTACT & SUPPORT  
For technical assistance, payment issues, or refund inquiries:  
Contact a verified developer via our official Discord support server.  
Include your transaction ID, receipt, and description of your issue for verification.
