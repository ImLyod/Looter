Refund Policy  

---

1. General Policy  
All sales are final. Because our product is a digital software-based macro program, refunds cannot be issued once an authentication key or license has been generated and delivered.  

2. Refund Eligibility  
Refunds may only be considered under specific circumstances:  
- Duplicate purchases caused by a technical or payment error.  
- Payment successfully processed but no valid license key was received.  
- Stripe confirms an error in payment processing.  

Refunds will not be granted for:  
- Change of mind after purchase.  
- Issues caused by sharing, losing, or exposing your authentication key.  
- Incompatibility with your device, system configuration, or third-party software.  
- Suspension or termination due to violation of our Terms of Use.  

3. Requesting a Refund  
To request a refund, contact one of the developers in our official Discord within 7 days of purchase. Please include your payment receipt, transaction ID, and a brief explanation of your request.  

4. Refund Processing  
If approved, refunds are processed within 5â€“10 business days through Stripe, our secure payment provider.  

5. Payment Handling  
All payments are managed and processed exclusively by Stripe. We do not store or have access to your personal billing information.
